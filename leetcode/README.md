# LeetCode - Guide

> Posted: 09.17.2019

The LeetCode section only tracks problems whose algorithms I am unfamiliar with.  

It is not a `LEETCODE HARD PROBLEMS` section nor a `LEETCODE CLASSIC PROBLEMS` section.

If you happen to have a problem that you are uncomfortable with in this list, just take a look.  
The explanations of algorithms are quite detailed, because I want to make sure that any time  
when I take a look at my own articles, I should be able to pick it up quickly.

The language I use is `Javascript`.  

## If you ask why not use Java, I would politely ask you to fuck off.
